# pong-game-using-python
This Python code creates a simple Pong game using the Turtle graphics library. In this game, two paddles are controlled by the player, one on the left and one on the right. A ball bounces between the paddles, and the goal is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle.

Here's a brief overview of the code's functionality:

    1.The game screen is set up with a black background, and its dimensions are 800x600 pixels.

    2.Two paddles and a ball are created on the screen. The right paddle is controlled using the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys, while the left paddle is controlled 
    using the 'w' and 's' keys.

    3.A scoreboard keeps track of the score for each player.

    4.The game is played in a loop, with the ball continuously moving and bouncing off walls and paddles.

     5.When the ball goes past the right paddle, a point is scored for the left player, and when it goes past the left paddle, a point is scored for the right player.

     6.The game loop runs until the user clicks on the game screen to exit.

    7.This code provides a simple implementation of the classic Pong game, allowing players to test their reflexes and compete against each other.
